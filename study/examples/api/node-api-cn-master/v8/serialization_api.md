The serialization API provides means of serializing JavaScript values in a way
that is compatible with the [HTML structured clone algorithm][].
The format is backward-compatible (i.e. safe to store to disk).

*Note*: This API is under development, and changes (including incompatible
changes to the API or wire format) may occur until this warning is removed.
