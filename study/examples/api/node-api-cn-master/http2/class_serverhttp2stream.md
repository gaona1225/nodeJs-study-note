* Extends: {Http2Stream}

The `ServerHttp2Stream` class is an extension of [`Http2Stream`][] that is
used exclusively on HTTP/2 Servers. `Http2Stream` instances on the server
provide additional methods such as `http2stream.pushStream()` and
`http2stream.respond()` that are only relevant on the server.
