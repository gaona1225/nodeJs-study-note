The `'frameError'` event is emitted when an error occurs while attempting to
send a frame. When invoked, the handler function will receive an integer
argument identifying the frame type, and an integer argument identifying the
error code. The `Http2Stream` instance will be destroyed immediately after the
`'frameError'` event is emitted.
