The `http2.getDefaultSettings()`, `http2.getPackedSettings()`,
`http2.createServer()`, `http2.createSecureServer()`,
`http2session.settings()`, `http2session.localSettings`, and
`http2session.remoteSettings` APIs either return or receive as input an
object that defines configuration settings for an `Http2Session` object.
These objects are ordinary JavaScript objects containing the following
properties.

* `headerTableSize` {number} Specifies the maximum number of bytes used for
  header compression. The default value is 4,096 octets. The minimum allowed
  value is 0. The maximum allowed value is 2<sup>32</sup>-1.
* `enablePush` {boolean} Specifies `true` if HTTP/2 Push Streams are to be
  permitted on the `Http2Session` instances.
* `initialWindowSize` {number} Specifies the *senders* initial window size
  for stream-level flow control. The default value is 65,535 bytes. The minimum
  allowed value is 0. The maximum allowed value is 2<sup>32</sup>-1.
* `maxFrameSize` {number} Specifies the size of the largest frame payload.
  The default and the minimum allowed value is 16,384 bytes. The maximum
  allowed value is 2<sup>24</sup>-1.
* `maxConcurrentStreams` {number} Specifies the maximum number of concurrent
  streams permitted on an `Http2Session`. There is no default value which
  implies, at least theoretically, 2<sup>31</sup>-1 streams may be open
  concurrently at any given time in an `Http2Session`. The minimum value is
  0. The maximum allowed value is 2<sup>31</sup>-1.
* `maxHeaderListSize` {number} Specifies the maximum size (uncompressed octets)
  of header list that will be accepted. There is no default value. The minimum
  allowed value is 0. The maximum allowed value is 2<sup>32</sup>-1.

All additional properties on the settings object are ignored.
