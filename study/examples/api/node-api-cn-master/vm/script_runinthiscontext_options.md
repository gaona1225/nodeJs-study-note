* `options` {Object}
  * `filename` {string} Specifies the filename used in stack traces produced
    by this script.
  * `lineOffset` {number} Specifies the line number offset that is displayed
    in stack traces produced by this script.
  * `columnOffset` {number} Specifies the column number offset that is displayed
    in stack traces produced by this script.
  * `displayErrors` {boolean} When `true`, if an [`Error`][] error occurs
    while compiling the `code`, the line of code causing the error is attached
    to the stack trace.
  * `timeout` {number} Specifies the number of milliseconds to execute `code`
    before terminating execution. If execution is terminated, an [`Error`][]
    will be thrown.

Runs the compiled code contained by the `vm.Script` within the context of the
current `global` object. Running code does not have access to local scope, but
*does* have access to the current `global` object.

The following example compiles code that increments a `global` variable then
executes that code multiple times:

```js
const vm = require('vm');

global.globalVar = 0;

const script = new vm.Script('globalVar += 1', { filename: 'myfile.vm' });

for (let i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
  script.runInThisContext();
}

console.log(globalVar);

// 1000
```
