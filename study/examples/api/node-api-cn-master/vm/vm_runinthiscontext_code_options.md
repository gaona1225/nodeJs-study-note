* `code` {string} The JavaScript code to compile and run.
* `options`
  * `filename` {string} Specifies the filename used in stack traces produced
    by this script.
  * `lineOffset` {number} Specifies the line number offset that is displayed
    in stack traces produced by this script.
  * `columnOffset` {number} Specifies the column number offset that is displayed
    in stack traces produced by this script.
  * `displayErrors` {boolean} When `true`, if an [`Error`][] error occurs
    while compiling the `code`, the line of code causing the error is attached
    to the stack trace.
  * `timeout` {number} Specifies the number of milliseconds to execute `code`
    before terminating execution. If execution is terminated, an [`Error`][]
    will be thrown.

`vm.runInThisContext()` compiles `code`, runs it within the context of the
current `global` and returns the result. Running code does not have access to
local scope, but does have access to the current `global` object.

The following example illustrates using both `vm.runInThisContext()` and
the JavaScript [`eval()`][] function to run the same code:

<!-- eslint-disable prefer-const -->
```js
const vm = require('vm');
let localVar = 'initial value';

const vmResult = vm.runInThisContext('localVar = "vm";');
console.log('vmResult:', vmResult);
console.log('localVar:', localVar);

const evalResult = eval('localVar = "eval";');
console.log('evalResult:', evalResult);
console.log('localVar:', localVar);

// vmResult: 'vm', localVar: 'initial value'
// evalResult: 'eval', localVar: 'eval'
```

Because `vm.runInThisContext()` does not have access to the local scope,
`localVar` is unchanged. In contrast, [`eval()`][] *does* have access to the
local scope, so the value `localVar` is changed. In this way
`vm.runInThisContext()` is much like an [indirect `eval()` call][], e.g.
`(0,eval)('code')`.
