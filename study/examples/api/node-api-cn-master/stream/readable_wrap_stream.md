* `stream` {Stream} An "old style" readable stream

Versions of Node.js prior to v0.10 had streams that did not implement the
entire `stream` module API as it is currently defined. (See [Compatibility][]
for more information.)

When using an older Node.js library that emits [`'data'`][] events and has a
[`stream.pause()`][stream-pause] method that is advisory only, the
`readable.wrap()` method can be used to create a [Readable][] stream that uses
the old stream as its data source.

It will rarely be necessary to use `readable.wrap()` but the method has been
provided as a convenience for interacting with older Node.js applications and
libraries.

For example:

```js
const { OldReader } = require('./old-api-module.js');
const { Readable } = require('stream');
const oreader = new OldReader();
const myReader = new Readable().wrap(oreader);

myReader.on('readable', () => {
  myReader.read(); // etc.
});
```
