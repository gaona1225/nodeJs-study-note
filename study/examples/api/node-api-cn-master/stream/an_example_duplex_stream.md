The following illustrates a simple example of a Duplex stream that wraps a
hypothetical lower-level source object to which data can be written, and
from which data can be read, albeit using an API that is not compatible with
Node.js streams.
The following illustrates a simple example of a Duplex stream that buffers
incoming written data via the [Writable][] interface that is read back out
via the [Readable][] interface.

```js
const { Duplex } = require('stream');
const kSource = Symbol('source');

class MyDuplex extends Duplex {
  constructor(source, options) {
    super(options);
    this[kSource] = source;
  }

  _write(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    // The underlying source only deals with strings
    if (Buffer.isBuffer(chunk))
      chunk = chunk.toString();
    this[kSource].writeSomeData(chunk);
    callback();
  }

  _read(size) {
    this[kSource].fetchSomeData(size, (data, encoding) => {
      this.push(Buffer.from(data, encoding));
    });
  }
}
```

The most important aspect of a Duplex stream is that the Readable and Writable
sides operate independently of one another despite co-existing within a single
object instance.
