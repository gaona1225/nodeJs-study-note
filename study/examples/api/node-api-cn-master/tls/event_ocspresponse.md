The `'OCSPResponse'` event is emitted if the `requestOCSP` option was set
when the `tls.TLSSocket` was created and an OCSP response has been received.
The listener callback is passed a single argument when called:

* `response` {Buffer} The server's OCSP response

Typically, the `response` is a digitally signed object from the server's CA that
contains information about server's certificate revocation status.
