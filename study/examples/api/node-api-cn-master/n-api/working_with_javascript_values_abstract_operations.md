N-API exposes a set of APIs to perform some abstract operations on JavaScript
values. Some of these operations are documented under
[Section 7](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-abstract-operations)
of the [ECMAScript Language Specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/).

These APIs support doing one of the following:
1. Coerce JavaScript values to specific JavaScript types (such as Number or
   String)
2. Check the type of a JavaScript value
3. Check for equality between two JavaScript values
