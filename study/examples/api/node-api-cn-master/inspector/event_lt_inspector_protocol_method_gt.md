* {Object} The notification message object

Emitted when an inspector notification is received that has its method field set
to the `<inspector-protocol-method>` value.

The following snippet installs a listener on the [`Debugger.paused`][]
event, and prints the reason for program suspension whenever program
execution is suspended (through breakpoints, for example):

```js
session.on('Debugger.paused', ({ params }) => {
  console.log(params.hitBreakpoints);
});
// [ '/node/test/inspector/test-bindings.js:11:0' ]
```
