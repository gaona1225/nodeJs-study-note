Used generically to signify an attempt to use a URL of an incompatible scheme
(aka protocol) for a specific purpose. It is currently only used in the
[WHATWG URL API][] support in the [`fs`][] module (which only accepts URLs with
`'file'` scheme), but may be used in other Node.js APIs as well in the future.
